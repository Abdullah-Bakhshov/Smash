# Todo List

<!--@START_MENU_TOKEN@-->Summary<!--@END_MENU_TOKEN@-->

## Overview



Bugs and errors that need fixing:

- Need to make the login page faster however everything is good for the time being, add the navigation transition and remove transition logic from there will fix it.
- When you write a password after username pops up then put the username to empty the password doesnt clear
- Animations need to be added when tab pages open , implement navigationtransition and can use that.


Bigger Implementations:

- Add video to start session and be able to record video and save video, going to do this now. DONEâœ…


- Implement a timer and a way to add a point on the timer and make the video better and a way to open and see it on the app.
- Add the watch OS -> UI and WCSession implementation shouldnt be too dificult, add heart sensor idk how yet
- Store Highlights in clips -> Serialisation to store it onto disk (locally for the time being then maybe to the cloud)
- Save previous match history and show it in history tab


Further down the line stuff:

- Add account system 
- Have double authentication 
- Have online sessions


-> Use firebase or alternative for the time being and then implement my own thing later if I want
